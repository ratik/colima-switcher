# COLIMA instance switcher

## What is this?

This is a simple MacOsX app that allows you to switch between different instances of `colima`. 

## Why?

Because sometimes it's a pain to have to type `colima start` and `colima stop` every time you want to switch between instances. Also it displays the current status of the instance.
